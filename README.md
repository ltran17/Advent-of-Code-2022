# Advent-of-Code-2022

My goal for this year is to earn 25 of 50 possible stars, a number that feels attainable during this busy season. This is my third year participating: in 2020 I was a novice coder and these puzzles took me a long time to complete. I stop when I solve the puzzle: no refactoring here! There's too much else to do.

## Things I've learned about my coding:
* I have improved! It takes me less time to complete the problems than it did two years ago. Also I'm getting the solutions on the first submission.
* I am wordy. Does this mean overcomplicated? It might. I'm trying to apply best practices with self-documenting code (as in Robert C. Martin's *Clean Code*) with choice of variable names, a function that does exactly one thing and does it well, etc.

Stars earned (as of 12/10): 16

## Day 01: :star2: :star2:
     Warm up problem. I remembered how annoying it was to create four files a day so made a couple of utility functions to make it go a little faster. 
## Day 02: :star2: :star2:
     Rock-Paper-Scissors with scoring. Straightforward. 
## Day 03: :star2: :star2:
     Rucksack prioritization. The set data structure was helpful here. Quick solve.
## Day 04: :star2: :star2:
     Camp cleanup. My final line of code is `sum([does_overlap(assignment) for assignment in assignments])`. I've seen other solutions where it is one line of code IN TOTAL. Amazing. Also not my style.
## Day 05: :star2: :star2:
     A stacking problem, so used a stack-style data structure, the `LifoQueue`. The biggest challenge was parsing the input.    
## Day 06: :star2: :star2:
     Signal processing. If only real life signal processing were so easy.
## Day 07: :star2: :star2:
     Skipped it because it doesn't look fun -- but I could come back to it if I need the stars to reach my goal.
## Day 08: :star2: :star2:
     The forest and the trees. The data scientist in me wanted to bring in a dataframe instead of dealing with a 2-D array, but I stuck it out and solved just fine. I took advantage of the fact that functions are first class objects in Python. This may be a clue that this would be better solved by object oriented programming but that would be future, refactoring work. 
## Day 09: :star2: :star2:
     Rope bridge. Got tripped up in part 2, so I read the directions carefully and had to contemplate this advice for a while: `...Be careful: more types of motion are possible than before...` Figuring that out was the key to the solution.
## Day 10: not yet attempted
